# Workspaces

(Package is also counted as workspace TODO: write more about it)

Create a new workspace is easy in 2 steps:

1. Create a new folder in whereever you want. (if it is shared code between projects, create it in `packages` folder)
2. Create a new `package.json` file in that folder.
   - Name: the name of the workspace ex. client, api-server
