# Workspace scripts

 

## Overview

Workspace scripts are predefined commands in `package.json` that help automate common tasks, making it easier to manage the development workflow. Each workspace in the project has its own `package.json` file containing scripts to execute commands specific to that workspace. Note that you need to navigate to the appropriate workspace directory before running a script.

### Turbo

We use `turbo` to run scripts across all workspaces simultaneously. To enable this functionality, define the script in the root-level [package.json](/package.json) using the following format:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "<script_name>": "turbo <script_name>"
  }
}
```

Next, add the script name in the [turbo.json](/turbo.json) file so that Turbo knows which scripts to execute. For example:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "script_name": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** You can configure additional settings, such as caching behavior, in the turbo.json file under the script name field.

Finally, define the same script name in the `package.json` file of each workspace where you want the script to be executed. Make sure the script works correctly with the actual command (not turbo) in the workspace.
