# Dependencies management

 

## Install new dependencies

### Shared dependencies

Usually, we use `pnpm` to manage dependencies. To install new dependencies, use command:

```bash
pnpm install <package-name> [install-options]
```

Then, `pnpm` will install the package and save it to root `package.json` file that will share to all workspaces.

### Workspace dependencies

To install package to specific workspace use option `filter` (not share to another workspace) and follow by workspace name:

```bash
pnpm install <package-name> [install-options] --filter <workspace-name>
```

> NOTE: Workspace name is the name in `package.json` in that workspace.
